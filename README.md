# ckuperst-zsh-theme
my personal oh-my-zsh theme

# Installation

- copy the ckuperst.zsh-theme file to $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/themes/
- update your .zshrc with 'ckuperst' as your theme name
- make sure to also configure your root .zshrc appropriately if you want both shell ending emojis to work

# Notes

this is really just a simple theme based on nicoulaj theme using different unicode symbols.
